I am learning and writing about how machines can learn. My interest in all things AI began with my fascination with Tesla's Autopilot software. Would it actually be possible for a car to drive itself in every situation?

I wanted to learn more about the technology behind this and have embarked on a journey into machine learning. Since I don't have a professional background in coding or computer science, I go with "learning by doing". This approach is especially endorsed by [fast.ai's](https://www.fast.ai/) great online courses.

I work as a pilot for a large airline. I think digitalization and AI can help aviation become more sustainable and even safer. But from my experience with partially automated systems, I also know how important it is to keep the human in the loop. AI should not replace humans, it should support them!

Reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/daflowjoe), I enjoy talking and learning about machine learning, aviation, space flight... let's nerd out!
