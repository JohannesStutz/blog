Maybe you are not too sure what they mean specifically, but you want to know more. Maybe you've been searching for a while to finally learn about these concepts, but are overwhelmed by the magnitude of courses, books and software available.\n",

    "## About fast.ai\n",
    "[fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) is an organization committed to making deep learning more accessible. It was founded by Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas, both distinguished data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "They offer four major elements that can help you get into deep learning.\n",
    "- [fastai](https://docs.fast.ai/) (notice the missing dot), a software library that allows creating powerful deep learning models with few lines of code, while nonetheless being very customizable.\n",
    "- A [free online course](https://course.fast.ai/) based on the library.\n",
    "- A [book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527) that is designed to go hand in hand with the course. It's available as a paper book, as an e-book or even for free on [Github](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook).\n",
    "- A [forum](https://forums.fast.ai/) with a very helpful community.\n",
    "\n",
    "For me, what really sets fast.ai apart from other online courses, is their practical approach:\n",
    "> We \\[are\\] always teaching through examples. We ensure that there is a context and a purpose that you can understand intuitively, rather than starting with algebraic symbol manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not mean that the foundations are not covered (they are!), but the order is different than in other books or courses, where you start with basic tools and only get to usable applications at the end of the course - if ever."

    "\n",
    "The course covers major applications of deep learning. There is a certain focus on computer vision, but the other topics like tabular data, natural language processing (NLP), and recommender systems are explained as well. You will be able to create very well performing models in all of these areas, and as early as lecture 2 you can create a working web app that can recognize grizzly bears and brown bears (or anything else you choose).\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the course, you will learn the foundations of deep learning. You'll write code for *stochastic gradient descent* and *activation functions* from scratch. Don't worry if you never have heard about these, it's explained very well. You will dig deeper into PyTorch, the underlying software of fastai.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, there is a lecture (and a chapter) on Data Ethics. It is taught by Rachel Thomas and will give you a lot of food for thought. I think it's great that fastai encourages you to think about the possible implications of your work early on."

    "\n",
    "Since the book is freely available online in the form of notebooks, you might be wondering if you should get the printed book anyway. My opinion: If you can afford it - yes, you absolutely should get it! Its layout is beautiful, which makes it easier to read than the online version. Also, I personally just like to read a physical copy: my attention span is longer and I tend to take it more seriously.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, you certainly can work with the free online version. It has the added benefit that you will always have the latest version, which is up to date and where bugs are fixed (and there are a few in the book).\n",

    "\n",
    "Yes - or any other language. The book is called \"Deep Learning for Coders\", so it will not explain every line of code in detail or teach Python from scratch. In fact, the [course website](https://course.fast.ai/) states:\n",
    "> The only prerequisite is that you know how to code (a year of experience is enough), preferably in Python, and that you have at least followed a high school math course. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, you don't have to be an expert. When I first started with the course, I only had a few weeks of experience with Python. I did however have some (very basic) experience with web languages like JavaScript and PHP, that helped me pick up Python pretty quickly. If you know any programming language, you won't have a problem, since Python is rather accessible and has an easy syntax. If you don't have any programming experience, I recommend investing a few weeks to learn the basics of Python before you tackle fastai. There are wonderful tutorials available for free.\n",

    "\n",
    "I enjoyed combining the videos and the book. After every lesson, I ran the associated notebooks on Colab and then read the chapters in the book. The chapters are very similar to the video lessons, but I think it helps consuming the content in a different medium and being able to go back a few pages if you want to read something again."

    "I recommend watching the videos twice. On the first view, don't focus on the details too much, just get an overview of the topics covered and take some notes while doing so. This is especially relevant for the later lessons that contain much more code. On the second view, you can take more detailed notes and try to get all the details."

Just reading the code in the book is not enough, it can give you the illusion that you understood it, when in reality you could not reproduce it. I fell into this trap more than once..."
