Additionally, they interview many experts. The course aims to provide a high-level overview of privacy, what it means, where it currently fails, and how possible solutions look. One key point is that there are new privacy-enhancing technologies on the rise that will change the way how humans collaborate. This brings with it many career and business opportunities.\n",

    "This course is about privacy-transparency trade-offs and how they affect a huge number of problems. This lesson walks through some of the most important challenges to society and identifies how the privacy-transparency tradeoff underpins them. Improving information flows, by solving this tradeoff, can help us in many areas like disinformation, scientific innovation, and even democracy itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Important: Information flows are everywhere!\n",
    "\n",
    "We share our medical information with our doctor, we share our location with an app to get directions, we share our heart rates and sleeping patterns in hopes of improving our well-being. Every day, we share personal information to exchange goods, receive services, and in general, to collaborate. Sharing information is a part of almost every aspect of our life. You have to fully grasp this statement to understand how these flows are going to change in the future.\n",

    "## Concept 2: Information Flow\n",
    "What is an information flow? Let's take the simple example of email. A sender, a message, a receiver. Hit send and that's an information flow. But it's much more nuanced than just the three attributes sender, message, receiver: \n",
    "- Should other people than the receiver be allowed to read it?\n",
    "- Would I be comfortable with the receiver forwarding my email, is this the intended information flow?\n",
    "- What about the mail provider, they could probably read it, but I believe they just choose not to.\n",
    "- Do I want the mail provider to read my mail only for a specific purpose, like for spam detection, but not for targeted advertising?\n",
    "- Am I sending my exact identity with the email? Anonymously? Or a mix: as a member of group?\n",
    "- Identity of the recipient: do I know exactly who they are? When I'm sending the mail to a specific group like a doctor's office, who reads it? \n",
    "- But also: can the receiver have confidence in sender identity, whaf if my account was hacked?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sending an email is probably one of the most straight-forward information flows and still there are many questions. These questions and more exist around every information flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "New communication channels emerged. Snapchat deletes the messages once they've been read and prohibits forwarding or screenshotting. WhatsApp or Signal use end-to-end encryption for messages so it's impossible for anyone other than the intended recipient to read them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Users switch to these services because of seemingly tiny changes to the guarantees around information flow.\n",
    "This is the beginning of a revolution!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Important: Every part of the human experience is soaked in information flows. Since the beginning of human collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: A more formal definition: An information flow is a flow of bits from a sender to a receiver. The sender and receiver could either be an exact individual, a member of a group, or an anonymous individual. The identity of the sender, the receiver, and the content of the message itself can be probabilistic!"

    "\n",
    "My location is public information for everybody standing on the same street. So why do I feel uncomfortable with my location being tracked? Or Google Street View: why are people having trouble with Google taking photos of them in their front yard, when anybody could come by and see them exactly there? Because public information can become *so much more public* that it starts to bother us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy is not about secrecy. People feel that their privacy is violated if information flows in a way they didn't expect and didn't like. It's all about appropriateness. Privacy is about flow, not the information itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: **Conceptual Integrity:** sharing the same information might be private in one context, but not in another context. It's about achieving appropriate information flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Facial recognition software. My face is public information as soon as I leave the house. So why is facial recognition bad? Not only because it could be misused (mass surveillance), but because I don't consent to the information flow.\n",

    "Two main differences between facial recognition as ID and normal ID:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tI can't change my face. If it gets in the wrong hands, you can't just get a new password or credit card.\n",
    "2.\tIt's identification without my consent. The information flow is not triggered by me, but by whatever system is watching me."

    "> Note: A privacy dilemma is a trade-off whether to reveal information, where revealing that information causes some social good (like medical research) but could also lead to harm (like the misuse of medical data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy dilemmas have various costs. The most obvious is the possible privacy violation. But there are other, societal costs: a failure to accomplish important outcomes of information flow (scientific progress, meaningful relationships, accountability)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: Privacy dilemmas are untapped market opportunities!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Everything can be private data\n",
    "Your grocery shopping list is boring, right? Not always. You might not care now whether somebody knows you're buying bread. But when you suddenly stop buying bread (and rice and other carbs) it might be an indication of the diagnosis of diabetes. Suddenly it's very private information that you might not want to share.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Warning: Anonymization doesn't work!\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when names are removed from data, other features can be used to identify you, thanks to the power of machine learning (i.e., 5 movies you watched last year and roughly when you watched them).\n",
    "\n",
    "Anonymization works so badly, that systematically exploiting its weaknesses can be a core business model. Emma gives an example of a company that buys anonymized health data and distributes it to insurance companies. They can then for example raise insurance costs for high-risk communities like poor neighborhoods that are more likely to get sick. Harm is done without knowing any one individual! \n",
    "\n",
    "Another example: Strava released an anonymized heatmap that revealed home addresses of individuals (because they cycle from home to work) and the location of US military bases. So, privacy can be relevant not only on an individual level but on an organizational or even national security level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Targeting\n",
    "Acting on information. Advertisement, targeted disinformation, shaming, fraud, physical harm. Pinpointing someone's identity might not even be necessary. As long as someone is able to reach you (via your browser, your church, your neighborhood, ...), your name is absolutely not necessary to do harm."

    "\n",
    "A better way can be found in Taiwan, with the *Polis* system. A community-built, nation-wide application that supports conversation between millions of users in Taiwan. It's not optimized for *engagement*, but for *consensus*. People can enter their opinions in written form (tweet-like), and a combination of NLP and voting clusters these opinions. Turns out, opinions aren't actually individual. There are less opinions than there are people because opinions are formed socially. However, the social groups that form our opinions aren't fixed but constantly changing.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Example: Uber wanted to come to Taiwan. Very polarized opinions. The solution was: Uber was permitted a temporary license in Taiwan. During this time, the public Taxi sector should adopt the efficient, algorithmic approaches from Uber while maintaining labor standards. If they would succeed, Uber would be banned. If they failed, Uber would be banned unless they met the labor standards of the public system. That put just enough pressure on both sides, and in the end, the public system did improve so much that Uber was excluded."

But even companies that run on a subscription model, like Netflix, do it. The Netflix CEO even said, they are competing with the time you spend sleeping. The question is: why?\n",
    "\n",
    "One answer is, it's a readily available metric that is fine-grained and allows for optimization. If Netflix just used the number of subscribers (and that's the value they actually try to increase), it would be too coarse. Only if a movie was that good or that bad that users actually subscribed/unsubscribed it would be measurable. \n",

    "Attention as a metric does work, and it is probably fine at a small scale. But at large scale and taken to the extremes it can cause harm, see the Netflix/sleep example.\n",

A baseless rumor might have a natural R value of 0.01 (1 in a 100 people would spread it).
