This lesson walks through some of the most important challenges to society and identifies how the privacy-transparency trade-off underpins them. Improving information flows, by solving this trade-off, can help us in many areas like disinformation, scientific innovation, and even democracy itself.\n",

    "> Important: Every part of the human experience is soaked in information flows. Since the beginning of human collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We share our medical information with our doctor, we share our location with an app to get directions, we share our heart rates and sleeping patterns in hopes of improving our well-being. Every day, we share personal information to exchange goods, receive services, and in general, to collaborate. Sharing information is a part of almost every aspect of our life."

    "## Information Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an information flow? Let's take the simple example of email. A sender, a message, a receiver. Probably one of the most straight-forward information flows. But even email is much more nuanced than just the three attributes sender, message, receiver: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Should other people than the receiver be allowed to read it?\n",
    "- Would I be comfortable with the receiver forwarding my email?\n",
    "- The email provider could probably read it, do I trust them to not do so?\n",
    "- Do I want the email provider to read my mail only for a specific purpose, like for spam detection, but not for targeted advertising?\n",
    "- Am I sending my exact identity with the email? Anonymously? Or a mix: as a member of group?\n",
    "- Do I know exactly who the recipient is? When I'm sending the mail to a doctor's office, who reads it? \n",
    "- Can the receiver have confidence in the identity of the sender, whaf if my account was hacked?\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions like these exist around every information flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Newly emerging communication channels: Snapchat deletes the messages once they've been read and prohibits forwarding or screenshotting. WhatsApp or Signal use end-to-end encryption for messages so it's impossible for anyone other than the intended recipient to read them.  Users switch to these services because of seemingly tiny changes to the guarantees around information flow.\n",
    "This is the beginning of a revolution!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Definition: An **information flow** is a flow of bits from a sender to a receiver. The sender and receiver could either be an exact individual, a member of a group, or an anonymous individual. The identity of the sender, the receiver, and the content of the message itself can be probabilistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probabilistic nature is important. Often a piece of information you share does not have an exact recipient."

    "## What Does Privacy Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy is not about secrecy. People feel that their privacy is violated if information flows in a way they didn't expect. It's all about the *appropriate flow of information*, not about the information itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: **Privacy** means the ability to ensure information flows that are according to social norms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Google Street View: why are people having trouble with Google taking photos of them in their front yard, when anybody could come by and see them exactly there? Because when public information becomes *so much more public*, it bothers us.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: This theory of privacy is called **Contextual Integrity:** sharing the same information might be private in one context, but not in another context. It's about achieving appropriate information flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "(There is a bit more to the concept, developed by Helen Nissenbaum, see details on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_Integrity))\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** My face is considered public information as soon as I leave the house, because anybody can see it. So why is facial recognition software so troubling? Not only because it could be misused (i.e., for mass surveillance), but because it is identification without my consent. The information flow is not triggered by me, but by whatever system is watching me."

    "- It can help us prosper and solve problems\n",

    "\n",
    "### Everything can be private data\n",
    "\n",
    "Your grocery shopping list is boring, right? Not always. You might not care *now* whether somebody knows you're buying bread. But when you suddenly *stop* buying bread (and other carbs), it might be an indication of the diagnosis of diabetes. Suddenly it's very private information that you might not want to share.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Warning: Anonymization doesn't work!\n",
    "\n",
    "While anonymization seems like the obvious solution to protect the identities of people in data, this does not work reliably. Even when names are removed from data, other features can be used to identify you, thanks to the power of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "And even when your exact identity is not recoverable, data can be used for **targeting**: As long as someone is able to reach you (via your browser, your church, your neighborhood, ...), your name is not at all necessary to do harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Anonymization works so badly, that systematically exploiting its weaknesses can become a business model. Emma talks about a US company that buys anonymized health data and distributes \"market insights\" from it to insurance companies. They can then, for example, avoid selling insurance to high-risk communities like poor neighborhoods, where people are more likely to get sick.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another **example:** Strava released an anonymized heatmap of user activities that revealed the location of US military bases. So, privacy can be relevant not only on an individual level but on an organizational or even national security level.\n",

    "\n",
    "Remember the dual-use of data ðŸ”¥ from the previous section. Due to the potentially harmful use of data, we have to constantly make trade-offs and decide whether to share information, weighing the benefits and the risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: A **privacy dilemma** is a trade-off whether or not to reveal information, where revealing that information causes some social good (like advances in medical research) but could also lead to harm (like the misuse of medical data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy dilemmas have various costs. The most obvious is a privacy violation where data is shared in good faith but the information is misused. On the other hand, there are societal costs when information instead is kept secret: a failure to accomplish important outcomes of information flow (scientific progress, meaningful relationships, accountability).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: Privacy dilemmas are untapped market opportunities!\n",
    "\n",
    "Closely related is the transparency dilemma:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: A **transparency dilemma** is when someone is forced to make a decision without having access to the information they need to make it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the necessary information flows don't exist at all (trusting a stranger to fix your tire), sometimes they exist but their content is not verified (online reviews).\n",
    "\n",
    "Stopping all information flow and locking all data is not the solution to the privacy issue. This would prevent good use of data (think medical care, climate research) and also make undesirable behaviour easier (money laundering, lack of accountability). Maximizing privacy could lead to a lack of transparency!"

    "Most services that handle your data will profit from locking you in. Because of privacy concerns they are inherently anti-competitive. More privacy restrictions can actually make it harder for new companies to compete (because you can't move your data from your old to the new provider).\n",
    "\n",
    "We need more interoperability between information service providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: **Interoperability** means you can buy your shoes from one company and your socks from another. In information services it also means that you should be able to move to a different company and take your data with you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Facebook actually started as a company that profited a lot from interoperability. One reason it gained popularity was that users from its established main competitor MySpace could connect their accounts with Facebook and still message with their friends on the old platform. Without this feature, probably less people would have switched to the new platform. This is called *adversarial interoperability*.\n",

A community-built, nation-wide application that supports conversation between millions of users in Taiwan. It's not optimized for *engagement*, but for *consensus*. People can enter their opinions in written form (tweet-like), and a combination of NLP and voting clusters these opinions. Turns out, opinions aren't actually individual. There are less opinions than there are people because opinions are formed socially. However, the social groups that form our opinions aren't fixed but constantly changing.\n",

During this time, the public Taxi sector should adopt the efficient algorithmic approaches from Uber while maintaining current labor standards. If they would succeed, Uber would be banned. If they failed, Uber would be banned unless they met the labor standards of the public system. That put just enough pressure on both sides, and in the end, the public system did improve so much that Uber was excluded."

The question is: why?\n",

    "The European Commission recently proposed the [Data Governance Act](https://iapp.org/news/a/proposal-for-an-eu-data-governance-act-a-first-analysis/) to improve data flows around the EU. The motivation: Businesses need data. And if they want to customize their product for each member state, they need data from these states. Data should flow easily through the EU and should be used in the most effective and responsible manner. This increased access to data would advance scientific developments and innovations all across the EU. This is especially important where coordinated action is necessary, like a global pandemic or tackling climate change.\n",

But to activate existing ways to fight disinformation: get people to help their friends. This might not seem as *efficient*, but will be more *effective* in the long run.\n",

    "The privacy-transparency trade-off or even privacy in general is in service of a higher aim: creating information flows within society that create social good.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Important: Privacy technology is not just about more privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't just look for use cases that scream \"privacy\". Instead, ask yourself: How can society accomplish its goals with less risk, higher accuracy, faster, and with better aligned incentives than ever before, through better flows of information. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: Entrepreneurial opportunities, regulatory opportunities, investing opportunities: It's not about hiding data; it's about enabling specific information flows (and just these!) to maximize social good.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is the promise of privacy-enhancing technology and has the potential to radically improve every aspect of how we share information.\n",
