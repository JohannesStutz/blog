Only the first one is online at the time of writing (06. Jan 2021).</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://courses.openmined.org/courses/our-privacy-opportunity">Our Privacy Opportunity</a></li>
<li>Foundations of Private Computation</li>
<li>Federated Learning Across Enterprises</li>
<li>Federated Learning on Mobile</li>
</ol>
<p>The first course is non-technical and contains about 8 hours of video, taught by <a href="https://twitter.com/emmabluemke">Emma Bluemke</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/iamtrask">Andrew Trask</a>. Additionally, they interview many experts. The course aims to provide an overview of what privacy means, where it currently fails, and how possible solutions look like. One key point is that there are new privacy-enhancing technologies on the rise that will change the way how humans collaborate. This brings with it many career and business opportunities.</p>

<p>Lesson 1 is just introductory. This is my summary of Lesson 2 of <em>Our Privacy Opportunity</em>. In addition, I can recommend <a href="https://www.nahua.dev/series/privacy_ai_course_notes/course-1-lesson-2-summary/">Nahua Kang's great summary</a>, it is more thouroughly structured than mine, which I primarily wrote for my forgetful self.</p>

<h2 id="Society-Runs-on-Information-Flows">Society Runs on Information Flows<a class="anchor-link" href="#Society-Runs-on-Information-Flows"> </a></h2><p>This course is about privacy-transparency trade-offs and how they affect a huge number of problems. This lesson walks through some of the most important challenges to society and identifies how the privacy-transparency trade-off underpins them. Improving information flows, by solving this trade-off, can help us in many areas like disinformation, scientific innovation, and even democracy itself.

   <span class="Toast-content">Every part of the human experience is soaked in information flows. Since the beginning of human collaboration.</span>
</div>
We share our medical information with our doctor, we share our location with an app to get directions, we share our heart rates and sleeping patterns in hopes of improving our well-being. Every day, we share personal information to exchange goods, receive services, and in general, to collaborate. Sharing information is a part of almost every aspect of our life.</p>

<h2 id="Information-Flow">Information Flow<a class="anchor-link" href="#Information-Flow"> </a></h2><p>What is an information flow? Let's take the simple example of email. A sender, a message, a receiver. Probably one of the most straight-forward information flows. But even email is much more nuanced than just the three attributes sender, message, receiver:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should other people than the receiver be allowed to read it?</li>
<li>Would I be comfortable with the receiver forwarding my email?</li>
<li>The email provider could probably read it, do I trust them to not do so?</li>
<li>Do I want the email provider to read my mail only for a specific purpose, like for spam detection, but not for targeted advertising?</li>
<li>Am I sending my exact identity with the email? Anonymously? Or a mix: as a member of group?</li>
<li>Do I know exactly who the recipient is? When I'm sending the mail to a doctor's office, who reads it? </li>
<li>Can the receiver have confidence in the identity of the sender, whaf if my account was hacked?</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions like these exist around every information flow.</p>
<p>Newly emerging communication channels: Snapchat deletes the messages once they've been read and prohibits forwarding or screenshotting. WhatsApp or Signal use end-to-end encryption for messages so it's impossible for anyone other than the intended recipient to read them.  Users switch to these services because of seemingly tiny changes to the guarantees around information flow.
This is the beginning of a revolution!

   <span class="Toast-content">Definition: An <strong>information flow</strong> is a flow of bits from a sender to a receiver. The sender and receiver could either be an exact individual, a member of a group, or an anonymous individual. The identity of the sender, the receiver, and the content of the message itself can be probabilistic.</span>
</div>
The probabilistic nature is important. Often a piece of information you share does not have an exact recipient.</p>

<h2 id="What-Does-Privacy-Mean?">What Does Privacy Mean?<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-Does-Privacy-Mean?"> </a></h2><p>Privacy is not about secrecy. People feel that their privacy is violated if information flows in a way they didn't expect. It's all about the <em>appropriate flow of information</em>, not about the information itself.

   <span class="Toast-content"><strong>Privacy</strong> means the ability to ensure information flows that are according to social norms.</span>
</div>
<strong>Example:</strong> Google Street View: why are people having trouble with Google taking photos of them in their front yard, when anybody could come by and see them exactly there? Because public information can become <em>so much more public</em> that it starts to bother us.

   <span class="Toast-content">This theory of privacy is called <strong>Contextual Integrity:</strong> sharing the same information might be private in one context, but not in another context. It&#8217;s about achieving appropriate information flow.</span>
</div>
(There is a bit more to the concept, developed by Helen Nissenbaum, see details on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_Integrity">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> My face is considered public information as soon as I leave the house, because anybody can see it. So why is facial recognition software so troubling? Not only because it could be misused (i.e., for mass surveillance), but because it is identification without my consent. The information flow is not triggered by me, but by whatever system is watching me.</p>

Not always. You might not care <em>now</em> whether somebody knows you're buying bread. But when you suddenly <em>stop</em> buying bread (and other carbs), it might be an indication of the diagnosis of diabetes. Suddenly it's very private information that you might not want to share.

   <span class="Toast-content">Anonymization doesn&#8217;t work!</span>
</div>
While anonymization is the most obvious idea to protect the identities of people in data, this does not work reliably. Even when names are removed from data, other features can be used to identify you, thanks to the power of machine learning.</p>
<p>And even when your exact identity is not recoverable, data can be used for <strong>targeting</strong>: As long as someone is able to reach you (via your browser, your church, your neighborhood, ...), your name is absolutely not necessary to do harm.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Anonymization works so badly, that systematically exploiting its weaknesses can be a business model. Emma tells us about a US company that buys anonymized health data and distributes "market insights" from it to insurance companies. They can then, for example, avoid selling insurance to high-risk communities like poor neighborhoods, where people are more likely to get sick.</p>
<p>Another <strong>example:</strong> Strava released an anonymized heatmap of user activities that revealed the location of US military bases. So, privacy can be relevant not only on an individual level but on an organizational or even national security level.

   <span class="Toast-content">A <strong>privacy dilemma</strong> is a trade-off whether or not to reveal information, where revealing that information causes some social good (like advances in medical research) but could also lead to harm (like the misuse of medical data).</span>
</div>
Privacy dilemmas have various costs. The most obvious is a privacy violation when information is revealed, but gets misused. But there are other, societal costs when information instead is kept secret: a failure to accomplish important outcomes of information flow (scientific progress, meaningful relationships, accountability).

</div>
Sometimes the necessary information flows don't exist at all (trusting a stranger to fix your tire), sometimes they exist but their content is not verified (online reviews).</p>
<p>The solution to privacy is not to stop all information flow and lock all data. This would prevent good use of data (think medical care, climate research) and also make undesirable behaviour easier (money laundering, lack of accountability). Maximizing privacy could lead to a lack of transparency!</p>

<h3 id="Data,-Energy,-and-the-Environment">Data, Energy, and the Environment<a class="anchor-link" href="#Data,-Energy,-and-the-Environment"> </a></h3><p>One of society's biggest challenges is the transition to sustainable energy production. The volatile nature of renewable energy sources makes nation-wide coordination of energy demand necessary.</p>
<p>An area where the privacy-transparency trade-off comes into play is smart meters. Smart meters are highly valuable for the transition to clean energy. Grid operators can have an accurate picture of energy demand, consumers can reduce energy waste. But smart meters can also be extremely privacy invasive, because one can build rich patterns of your energy data. How your daily habits are, when you are or are not at home etc.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> In Taiwan, many people have air boxes in their homes to measure pollution. There was a <a href="https://www.taiwan-panorama.com.tw/en/Articles/Details?Guid=e34da4f0-b24c-4d88-9f63-e8ab3eee5aaa&amp;CatId=9">community-driven effort to collect these measurements</a>. They were able to coordinate with millions of people to get this data-sharing system working. The government didn't invest heavily in this technology, but was very interested in the data. In exchange, they installed more air boxes in places like public parks and military zones.

<h3 id="Democracy-&amp;-Public-Health-Conversation">Democracy &amp; Public Health Conversation<a class="anchor-link" href="#Democracy-&amp;-Public-Health-Conversation"> </a></h3><p>Democracy is messy. Opinions are formed via social groups. In recent years, there was an uptick in polarization, one of the reasons probably being social media, where algorithms maximize engagement.</p>
<p>A better way can be found in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/27/taiwan-civic-hackers-polis-consensus-social-media-platform">Taiwan, with the <em>Polis</em> system</a>. A community-built, nation-wide application that supports conversation between millions of users in Taiwan. It's not optimized for <em>engagement</em>, but for <em>consensus</em>. People can enter their opinions in written form (tweet-like), and a combination of NLP and voting clusters these opinions. Turns out, opinions aren't actually individual. There are less opinions than there are people because opinions are formed socially. However, the social groups that form our opinions aren't fixed but constantly changing.</p>
<p>So, some people emerge as being representative for specific opinions and become thought leaders for this particular matter. But now they must come up with a formulation that will get the most consent <em>across opinions</em>! [Not sure if I got this exactly right]</p>
<p>Example: Uber wanted to come to Taiwan. Very polarized opinions. The solution was: Uber was permitted a temporary license in Taiwan. During this time, the public Taxi sector should adopt the efficient, algorithmic approaches from Uber while maintaining labor standards. If they would succeed, Uber would be banned. If they failed, Uber would be banned unless they met the labor standards of the public system. That put just enough pressure on both sides, and in the end, the public system did improve so much that Uber was excluded.</p>

<h3 id="New-Market-Incentives">New Market Incentives<a class="anchor-link" href="#New-Market-Incentives"> </a></h3><p>Many online (information-based) companies rely on attention (engagement) as their key metric. For some, this makes intuitive sense because their revenue is ad-driven. But even companies that run on a subscription model, like Netflix, do it. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings famously said they are competing with sleep (<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40491939/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-sleep-is-our-competition">“And we’re winning!”</a>). The question is: why?</p>
<p>One answer is, it's a readily available metric that is fine-grained and allows for optimization. If Netflix just used the number of subscribers (and that's the value they actually try to increase), it would be too coarse. Only if a movie was that good or that bad that users actually subscribed/unsubscribed it would be measurable.</p>
<p>Attention as a metric does work, and it is probably fine at a small scale. But at large scale and taken to the extremes it can cause harm, see the Netflix/sleep example.</p>
<p>A better way: Netflix could try to optimize their experience to improve the users' sleep. But how would they measure it and train an algorithm on it? Fitbits track sleep but is it safe to share this data with Netflix?
In general, these alternative metrics are called wellness metrics and can improve our lives.

<p>A way to share private military information to determine the winner (in a digital war game) without actually giving the opponent this information could potentially avoid wars.</p>
<p>This is true for other conflicts as well, legal disputes, commercial competition. If the winner could be determined ahead some conflicts wouldn't be fought.</p>
<p>Moving the privacy-transparency trade-off is essential here as well.</p>

<h3 id="Disinformation-&amp;-Information-Flows">Disinformation &amp; Information Flows<a class="anchor-link" href="#Disinformation-&amp;-Information-Flows"> </a></h3><p>The flow of news is one of the most important information flows in the world. How do you know that what you read in the news is actually true?</p>
<p>Naturally, before the invention of the printing press, people had the power to talk to maybe 50 people at the same time. For a story to be shared outside your own social circle, you would have to convince other people to talk about it. Very comparable to the R number in infectious diseases. A baseless rumor might have a natural R value of 0.01 (1 in a 100 people would spread it). But today, where the average person has hundreds of contacts on social media, the R value is easily 10s or 100s of times bigger and fake news and rumors can spread.</p>
<p>How to check if news is true?</p>
<ul>
<li>Just wait for humans to adjust to the internet? Bad idea, when we look at the printing press, it took hundreds of years and many conflicts until humans adjusted to it.</li>
<li>Have social media platforms check every bit that is published? Not feasible for hundreds of millions of users.</li>
<li>Have AI and machine learning check whether a piece of news is true? Probably a bad idea in the long run, because news is an <em>information bottleneck</em>. Example: You receive a text message "I love you". Can you tell whether it's true just by looking at it? No! You have to have knowledge of the world. So, detecting fake news just by reading it is impossible.</li>
<li>Just get off social media? Maybe we're just not supposed be interconnected with that many people?</li>
</ul>
<p>The most interesting solution is currently being deployed in Taiwan:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/taiwan-democracy-social-media">The Polis platform</a> (developed by a hacker collective called g0v, pronounced "gov zero") where people interact, and trained volunteers comment on suspicious stories with other sources one might check. Because these comments come from people that you actually know or from your local community, not from a state's official or a platform, you already have a level of trust.</p>
<p>Two groups of ideas that seem to work highly effective:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's not so much about detecting misinformation and taking it down. It's more about fostering a national community that helps each other filter between truths and lies. People are relying on existing interpersonal relationships, instead of having to trust the state or the platform.</li>
<li>Taiwan is using technology and intentional narratives such as humor to foster trust between civil society and the state. Humor over rumor!</li>
</ol>

It doesn't fix the problem to let the platforms take down false posts. People are curious and won't just accept this as "huh, this is false then".</p>
<p>The beauty of Audrey Tang's work (with g0v): constructing information flows that are healthy for society. Not thinking about the most efficient way to prevent a data flow. But to activate existing ways to prevent disinformation: get people to help their friends and use humor.

Don't sit and look for use cases that scream "privacy". Instead, ask yourself: How can society accomplish its goals with less risk, higher accuracy, faster, and with better aligned incentives than ever before, through better flows of information.
