            "content": "Even after going through the course and book, I didn&#39;t feel comfortable with the numerous classes and methods that fastai offers for data processing. I felt that it would be easy once I understood it, but it just didn&#39;t click right away. So here I try to present the most important classes and why they are useful. . This is by no means a complete overview, but just an exploration with minimal examples. . For a deeper dive, please check out chapter 11 of fastbook, Wayde Gilliam&#39;s awesome blog post, or Zach Mueller&#39;s walk with fastai2. . Transforms . A Transform in general is an object that can be called (behaves like a function) and has an optional setup method that initializes an inner state, and an optional decode method that will reverse the function. . In general, our data is always in tuples of (input,target), although you can have more than one input or one target. When applying a transform, it should be applied to the elements of the tuple separately. . . . Note: Transforms are usually applied on tuples. . When you only want to implement the encoding behaviour of a transform, it can be defined via the @Transform decorator: . @Transform def lowercase(x:str): return str.lower(x) lowercase(&quot;Hello, Dear Reader&quot;) . &#39;hello, dear reader&#39; . Type dispatch . Transforms can be defined so they apply only to certain types. This concept is called type dispatch and is provided by fastcore, which I&#39;ll cover in a future post :-) . @Transform def square(x:int): return x**2 square((3, 3.)) . (9, 3.0) . Notice the type annotation for x. In this case, this is not merely a helpful annotation like in pure Python, but it actually changes the behaviour of the function! The square transform is only applied to elements of the type int. When we don&#39;t define the type, a transform is applied on all types. . A more complex transform . If you want to also define the setup and decode methods, you can inherit from Transform: . class DumbTokenizer(Transform): def setups(self, items): vocab = set([char for text in items for char in text]) self.c2i = {char: i for i, char in enumerate(vocab)} self.i2c = {i: char for i, char in enumerate(vocab)} def encodes(self, x): return [self.c2i.get(char, 999) for char in x] def decodes(self, x): return &#39;&#39;.join([self.i2c.get(n, &#39; ? &#39;) for n in x]) . texts = [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Bonjour&quot;, &quot;Guten Tag&quot;, &quot;Konnichiwa&quot;] tokenizer = DumbTokenizer() tokenizer.setup(texts) encoded = tokenizer(&quot;Hello!&quot;) encoded . [9, 6, 2, 2, 4, 999] . Now this is a representation that a machine learning model can work with. But we humans can&#39;t read it anymore. To display the data and be able to analyze it, call decode on the result: . tokenizer.decode(encoded) . &#39;Hello ? &#39; . So here we defined a (very dumb) tokenizer. The setups method receives a bunch of items that we pass in. It creates a vocabulary of all characters that appear in items. In encodes we transform each character to a number in an index. When the character is not found in the vocabulary, it is replaced with a 999 token. decodes reverses this transform as good as it can. . Notice the ? in the decoded representation instead of !. Since there was no ! in the initial texts, the tokenizer replaced it with the token for &quot;unkown&quot;, 999. This is then replaced with ? during decoding. . By the way: you might have noticed that in the DumbTokenizer class we defined the methods setups, encodes and decodes, but on the instance tokenizer we call methods with slightly different names (setup, decode) or even the instance directly: tokenizer(...). The reason for this is that fastai applies some magic in the background, the book says that the setup method does some additional work before and after calling setups. . Pipeline . A Pipeline is just an easy way to apply a list of transforms, in order. . tfms = Pipeline([lowercase, tokenizer]) encoded = tfms(&quot;Hello World!&quot;) encoded . [17, 6, 2, 2, 4, 11, 5, 4, 0, 2, 999, 999] . Pipeline also supports decoding of an item: . tfms.decode(encoded) . &#39;hello worl ? ? &#39; . Because we didn&#39;t define a decodes method for lowercase, this transform cannot be reversed. The decoded result consists only of lowercase letters. . What Pipeline doesn&#39;t provide is support for the setup of the transforms. When you want to apply a pipeline of transforms on a list of data, TfmdLists comes to the rescue. . TfmdLists . At first, your data is usually a set of raw items (like filenames or rows in a dataframe) to which you want to apply some transforms. To combine your pipeline of transforms with your set of raw items, use TfmdLists. . texts = [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Bonjour&quot;, &quot;Guten Tag&quot;, &quot;Konnichiwa&quot;] tls = TfmdLists(texts, [DumbTokenizer]) . When initialized, TfmdLists will call the setup method of each Transform in order, providing it with all the items of the previous Transform. To get the result of the pipeline on any raw element, just index into the TfmdLists: . encoded = tls[1] encoded . [8, 4, 14, 15, 4, 19, 0] . tls.decode(encoded) . &#39;Bonjour&#39; . Training and validation sets . The reason that TfmdLists is named with an s (lists in plural) is that it can handle a training and a validation set. Use the splits argument to pass . the indices of the elements that should be in the training set | the indices of the elements that should be in the validation set. | . We will just do this by hand in our toy example. The training set will be &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;Guten Tag&quot;, the other two go in the validation set. . texts = [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Bonjour&quot;, &quot;Guten Tag&quot;, &quot;Konnichiwa&quot;] splits = [[0,2],[1,3]] tls = TfmdLists(texts, [lowercase, DumbTokenizer], splits=splits) . We can then access the sets through the train and valid attributes: . encoded = tls.train[1] encoded, tls.decode(encoded) . ([3, 7, 1, 6, 4, 8, 1, 0, 3], &#39;guten tag&#39;) . Let&#39;s look at at word in the validation set: . encoded = tls.valid[0] encoded, tls.decode(encoded) . ([999, 2, 4, 999, 2, 7, 999], &#39; ? on ? ou ? &#39;) . Ouch, what happened to our &quot;Bonjour&quot; here? When TfmdLists automatically called the setup method of the transforms, it only used the items of the training set. Since there was no b, j or r in our training data, the tokenizer treats them as unknown characters. . . Important: The setup methods of the transforms receive only the items of the training set. . Don&#39;t we need labels? . Maybe you noticed that we haven&#39;t dealt with tuples until now. We only have transformed our input, we don&#39;t have a target yet. . TfmdLists is useful when you built a custom Transform that performs data preprocessing and returns tuples of inputs and targets. You can apply further transforms if you want, and then create a DataLoaders object with the dataloaders method. . . Usually however, you will have two parallel pipelines of transforms - one to convert your raw items to inputs, and one to convert raw items to targets (ie labels). To do this we can use Datasets. . Datasets . To complete our quick tour through fastai&#39;s midlevel API, we look at the Datasets class. It applies two (or more) pipelines in parallel to a list of raw items and builds tuples of the results. It performs very much like a TfmdLists object, in that it . automatically does the setup of all Transforms | supports training and validation sets | supports indexing | . The main difference is: When we index into it, it returns a tuple with the results of each pipeline. . Let&#39;s look at how to use it. For this toy example, let&#39;s pretend we want to classify whether a text contains at least one space (that&#39;s a dumb example, I know). For this we create a little labelling function in the form of a Transform. . class SpaceLabeller(Transform): def encodes(self, x): return int(&#39; &#39; in x) def decodes(self, x): return bool(x) . x_tfms = [lowercase, DumbTokenizer] y_tfms = [SpaceLabeller] dsets = Datasets(texts, [x_tfms, y_tfms], splits=splits) item = dsets.valid[1] item . ([10, 14, 13, 13, 8, 2, 7, 8, 22, 0], 0) . dsets.decode(item) . (&#39;konnichiwa&#39;, False) . At last, we can create a DataLoaders object from the Datasets. To enable processing on the GPU, two small tweaks are required. First, every item has to be converted to a tensor (often this will happen earlier, as one of the transforms in the pipeline). Second, we use a fastai function called pad_input to make every sequence the same length, since a tensor requires regular shape. . dls = dsets.dataloaders(bs=1, after_item=tensor, before_batch=pad_input) . dls.train_ds . (#2) [([7, 4, 11, 11, 14], 0),([6, 20, 19, 4, 13, 999, 19, 0, 6], 1)] . This is now a ready-for-training dataloader! . Conclusion . We looked at how to customize every step of the data transformation pipeline. As mentioned in the beginning, this is not a complete description of all the features available, but a good starting point for experimentation.

            "title": "Getting started with fast.ai",
            "content": "Welcome! . Summary: I cover some questions you might have regarding the fast.ai course. Then, I offer some advice that would have helped me in the beginning. . Who is this article for? . If you&#39;re reading this article, I assume you have heard about the terms deep learning, machine learning, or artificial intelligence. Maybe you are not too sure what they mean specifically, but you want to know more. Maybe you&#39;ve been searching for a while to finally learn about these concepts, but are overwhelmed by the magnitude of courses, books and software available. . Whether you are a software developer planning to add a new skillset, a student wanting to broaden your horizon, or an expert in a completely different field and you want to apply AI in your company or project: The fast.ai online course can be great for you to get started, and it&#39;s completely free! . . About fast.ai . fast.ai is an organization committed to making deep learning more accessible. It was founded by Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas, both distinguished data scientists. . They offer four major elements that can help you get into deep learning. . fastai (notice the missing dot), a software library that allows creating powerful deep learning models with few lines of code, while nonetheless being very customizable. | A free online course based on the library. | A book that is designed to go hand in hand with the course. It&#39;s available as a paper book, as an e-book or even for free on Github. | A forum with a very helpful community. | . For me, what really sets fast.ai apart from other online courses, is their practical approach: . We [are] always teaching through examples. We ensure that there is a context and a purpose that you can understand intuitively, rather than starting with algebraic symbol manipulation. . This does not mean that the foundations are not covered (they are!), but the order is different than in other books or courses, where you start with basic tools and only get to usable applications at the end of the course - if ever. . What is covered in the course? . The course covers major applications of deep learning. There is a certain focus on computer vision, but the other topics like tabular data, natural language processing (NLP), and recommender systems are explained as well. You will be able to create very well performing models in all of these areas, and as early as lecture 2 you can create a working web app that can recognize grizzly bears and brown bears (or anything else you choose). . Later in the course, you will learn the foundations of deep learning. You&#39;ll write code for stochastic gradient descent and activation functions from scratch. Don&#39;t worry if you never have heard about these, it&#39;s explained very well. You will dig deeper into PyTorch, the underlying software of fastai. . Also, there is a lecture (and a chapter) on Data Ethics. It is taught by Rachel Thomas and will give you a lot of food for thought. I think it&#39;s great that fastai encourages you to think about the possible implications of your work early on. . Should I get the book? . Since the book is freely available online in the form of notebooks, you might be wondering if you should get the printed book anyway. My opinion: If you can afford it - yes, you absolutely should get it! Its layout is beautiful, which makes it easier to read than the online version. Also, I personally just like to read a physical copy: my attention span is longer and I tend to take it more seriously. . That being said, you certainly can work with the free online version. It has the added benefit that you will always have the latest version, which is up to date and where bugs are fixed (and there are a few in the book). . . Do I need to know Python? . Yes - or any other language. The book is called &quot;Deep Learning for Coders&quot;, so it will not explain every line of code in detail or teach Python from scratch. In fact, the course website states: . The only prerequisite is that you know how to code (a year of experience is enough), preferably in Python, and that you have at least followed a high school math course. . However, you don&#39;t have to be an expert. When I first started with the course, I only had a few weeks of experience with Python. I did however have some (very basic) experience with web languages like JavaScript and PHP, that helped me pick up Python pretty quickly. If you know any programming language, you won&#39;t have a problem, since Python is rather accessible and has an easy syntax. If you don&#39;t have any programming experience, I recommend investing a few weeks to learn the basics of Python before you tackle fastai. There are wonderful tutorials available for free. . . I&#39;m in! How do I begin? . With lesson 1! 😊 You really can get started right away, the interactive content runs on ready-to-use and free platforms like Google Colab, so you don&#39;t have to spend time setting up your own machine. . The course website gives you an overview of the course (you can read it in addition to this article), then you can start with lesson 1. . I enjoyed combining the videos and the book. After every lesson, I ran the associated notebooks on Colab and then read the chapters in the book. The chapters are very similar to the video lessons, but I think it helps consuming the content in a different medium and being able to go back a few pages if you want to read something again. . My suggestions for efficient learning . Watch the videos twice . I recommend watching the videos twice. On the first view, don&#39;t focus on the details too much, just get an overview of the topics covered and take some notes while doing so. This is especially relevant for the later lessons that contain much more code. On the second view, you can take more detailed notes and try to get all the details. . Take notes! . Taking notes was a gamechanger for me. I think it&#39;s the best way to stay active during the videos, and over time the notes will serve as a central knowledge repository. Also, it&#39;s great to have a place to jot down your questions, so you can try and answer them later! . I keep notes in Microsoft OneNote, you can of course use any other application or paper. I created a template based on this awesome forum post. The template contains following points: . Key Points from the lecture | Advice from Jeremy | To-Do challenges from the further research section of the chapter, ideas for projects | Reading &amp; Exploring papers that are mentioned, stuff you find on the web but don&#39;t have time for at the moment | Questions that arise during the lecture | as the last point, I copy &amp; paste the questionnaire. | . Please read the above-mentioned forum post for details on each section, it&#39;s a really good system. . These notes are meant to be used not just once, but you should refine them and work with them continuously. They can serve you as your go-to resource every time you study. All your open questions, your project ideas, and of course lots of knowledge can live there. . . Don&#39;t get stuck on one thing that you don&#39;t understand . This is an important point and I think Jeremy mentions it as well. You don&#39;t have to understand every detail right away. It&#39;s often better to move on and revisit the part you didn&#39;t quite get later. . Run the code . Jeremy will ask you to do this, and you really should run the notebooks for yourself. I recommend the clean versions, where there is no text, just code. Predict what the output of a cell will be, and if you were wrong, go back and understand why. Just reading the code in the book is not enough, it can give you the illusion that you understood it, when in reality you could not reproduce it. I fell into this trap more than once... . Do the questionnaire . Take the time and answer every question in the questionnaire. This might take a while, but it makes sure that you really understood all important concepts. You can find answers to most questions in the forum. . Additionally, I can recommend aiquizzes.com, where many questions and their answers are made available together with the relevant part of the lecture. You can use this for spaced repetition learning, the website will remind you when older questions need reviewing, it&#39;s great. . Use other sources . Fastai, while being excellent, is not the only source of wisdom. I often google for concepts I don&#39;t quite get. More often than not I find a blog post, a stack overflow answer or a video explaining it very well or with a different approach than Jeremy. . What to do after the course . The course covers only around half the book. There will be a part 2 that covers the more advanced chapters, but as of now (December 2020) there is no release date announced. If you want to dig deeper into the material, you should not wait for the course but work through the book on your own. . In addition, I&#39;d suggest picking a project and make it as good as you can. Go on the forums and see if you can help others, or ask for advice. Write about your journey in your own blog - like the one whose first post you are reading here 😊 . Thank you for reading . Since you made it this far, I hope you found this article interesting and I could get you excited for fast.ai! I really can recommend taking the course and reading the book, and if you put in the time you will see amazing results soon. Let me know if you have any questions or found this article helpful. I&#39;m on Twitter, I&#39;d be happy to hear from you there or via mail at hannes@deeplearning.berlin .",
