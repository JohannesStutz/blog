            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png . Formatting text as YAML: . key: value - another_key: &quot;another value&quot; . Tables . Column 1 Column 2 . A thing | Another thing | . Tweetcards .

          "content": "Hi! My name is Johannes Stutz, I usually go with Hannes. I am learning and writing about how machines can learn. My interest in all things AI began with my fascination with Tesla’s Autopilot software. Would it actually be possible for a car to drive itself in every situation? . I wanted to learn more about the technology behind this and have embarked on a journey into machine learning. Since I don’t have a professional background in coding or computer science, I go with “learning by doing”, an approach especially endorsed and offered by fast.ai’s great - and free - online courses. . I work as a pilot for a large airline. I think digitalization and AI can help aviation become more sustainable and even safer. But from my experience with partially automated systems, I also know how important it is to keep the human in the loop. AI should not replace humans, it should support them! . Reach out to me on Twitter, I enjoy talking and learning about machine learning, aviation, space flight… let’s nerd out! . . Thank you .
